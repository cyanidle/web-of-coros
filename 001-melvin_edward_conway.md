Melvin Edward Conway is an American computer scientist, computer programmer, and hacker who coined what is now known as Conway's law: "Organizations, who design systems, are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations." 

Apart from the above, Conway is perhaps most famous for developing the concept of coroutines. Conway coined the term coroutine in 1958 and he was the first to apply the concept to an assembly program. He later authored a seminal paper on the subject of coroutines, titled "Design of a Separable Transition-diagram"

The algorithms described were verified on the 5000-word
Burroughs 220 at the Case Institute of Technology Computing Center. A two-pass configuration was planned for
that machine, and first-pass code was checked out through
the syntactical analysis. At the time the project was discontinued a complete CoBOL syntax checker was operating
at 140 fully-punched source cards per minute. (The Case
220 had a typical single-address instruction time of 100
microseconds.)
